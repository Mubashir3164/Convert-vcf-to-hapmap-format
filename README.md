# Convert Vcf to Hapmap

After installing tassel, put your vcf file into your current working directory then run the following command to convert vcf format to hapmap

./run_pipeline.pl -Xms10g -Xmx40g -fork1 -vcf data.vcf -export outputfilename -exportType Hapmap

Here, Xms10g and Xmx40g are intial and maximum memory sizes, respectively. Modify it according to the memory of your computer. 
 
 The output file will be a hapmap file. 
 
Tassel also has a GUI, if the size of vcf file is not very big, then tassel GUI can be used for conversion. However, for large datasets tassel commandline is recommended.
